## JOURNAL - React Project 

## Introduction 
JOURNAL is a web app that gives users a secure place to write their thoughts. Users can create entries and re-read them at a later time. 
JOURNAL was made as a fun and productive way to learn the basics of front - end development (ReactJS, CSS, Javascript / Typescript). 
JOURNAL uses Google Firebase / Firestore for its authentication and database storage and is hosted with Vercel.
